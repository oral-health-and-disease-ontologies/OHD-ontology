The project-library directory contains utilities (such as classes and macros) that are specific to this particular project.
That is, unlike the general-libary directory, the utilites created in this directory are not done so with the intent of
being used in other projects.

The gernal layout of the directories is as follows:

classes: class definitons and methods
macros: macros (duh)
utils: contains functions, project wide variables, and what ever else ...
test-scripts: files for testing the various utilities
