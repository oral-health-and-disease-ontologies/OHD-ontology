(defmacro push-items (place &rest items)
  "macro used for pushing muliple items onto a list. 
For example, instead of doing multiple push operations like so:
  (push `(declaration (class !A)) axioms)
  (push `(declaration (class !B)) axioms)
  (push `(declaration (class !C)) axioms)

push-items can be called like so:
  (push-items axioms
              `(declaration (class !A))
              `(declaration (class !B))
              `(declaration (class !C))
