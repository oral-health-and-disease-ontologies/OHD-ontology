The development-library directory contains utilities (such as classes and macros) that are not specific to this particular project.
The intent is that when starting a new project you can copy this directory and make use these utilities. 
The gernal layout of the directories is as follows:

classes: class definitons and methods
macros: macros (duh)
utils: contains functions, project wide variables, and what ever else ...
test-scripts: files for testing the various utilities
