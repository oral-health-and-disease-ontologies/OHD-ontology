## Hi Alan,

 
## As discussed on Friday, I would like to get a fairly limited subset
## of our data to play around with with one of our local visualization
## experts, Katy Boerner. Below is what I have written to her - it is
## fairly general since this is the first foray into applying her
## tools for clinical research problems.
 
## The data I thought would make sense for a limited set of data include:
## - patient ID (1, 2, 3, ...)
## - visit date
## - tooth
## - restoration procedure (we could leave it as amalgam or composite)
 
## This would make the data set quite sparse, but I think would be a
## reasonable start. I think something like all data for 200 patients,
## selected at random, might be good.
 
## Let me know what you think. I'm scheduled to talk with Katy on
## Wednesday. If we could have the data set by then, that would be
## great.
 
## Also, if possible, I would like to have the graphs/numbers for
## discussion with Claudio by today. I need to bring printouts (which
## I can most efficiently make it home) since were going to dinner
## tomorrow.
 
## Thanks, Titus

## Clarification
## << Ok, to clarify: You want tooth but not surface. >>
 
## Correct. Surface is too granular at this time.
## â€¦
 
## << For restoration procedure column you want the D code for any of
## the amalgam or composite restorations (1,2,3,4+ surfaces)? >>
 
## Yes, if I could have the ADA code (2140, 2150, etc.) then I can
## collapse these data as needed.

## Alan
