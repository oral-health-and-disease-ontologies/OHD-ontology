To get started, source("load.r")

You need to set a sparql endpoint for queries, e.g.

current_endpoint <- "http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame/repositories/ohd-partial"

You can then query the repository using the function queryc. Standard
prefixes are in prefix.r. If a prefix is registered there then you can
omit the PREFIX statement in the query - it will be added.

The function querystring (query) will show what the query looks like
with the prefixes.

e.g.

test <- function()
{ q<- "select  ?procedurel (count(?procedurei) as ?count)
where
{
  # patient instances
  ?patienti a dental_patient: .
  # procedure instances
  ?procedurei a dental_procedure: .
  # link to role that the procedure realize
  ?procedurei realizes: ?rolei .
  # make sure it is a patient role  
  ?rolei a patient_role: .
  # and that it's one of the patient's
  ?rolei inheres_in: ?patienti.
  # technically we don't need the next check for participation
  ?patienti participates_in: ?procedurei.
  # get the type of procedure
  ?procedurei a ?procedurec.
  # and the label for that class, for reporting since we are summarizing by *type* of procedure
  ?procedurec rdfs:label ?procedurel.
  ?procedurec rdfs:label ?procedurel.
}
# group by controls what is counted. We get a count for every set of
# results with the same procedure label
group by ?procedurel
# and sort with most frequent at the top
order by desc(?count)
";
querystring(q)
}

test()
->
PREFIX dental_patient: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OHD_0000012>

Plotting.

ggplot vs. plot

When using plot, one uses par(mfrow=c(2,2)) and then sequential plots
which get arranged in the 2x2 grid.

When using ggplot one collects the plots, plot1 <- ggplot(...),plot2
<- ggplot(...),plot3 <- ggplot(...) and then they are arranged into a grid using
grid.arrange from the gridExtras library.

I've been plotting to an svg device, which writes an svg to a file and
then browsing the file in the web browser. To create PDFs I print to PDF.

Note that when using the svg device, one must call print(ggplot(...))
to get it to show up.
